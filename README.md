# DBSCAN
Outlier detection using DBSCAN algorithm (Unsupervised Machine Learning)

Objective of this prototype:
To detect outliers in network traffic using an adaptive
clustering algorithm

The prototype is built using python script and imports Scikit learn library that

a) Reads the data and identify features specified.

b) Preform pre-processing steps (one hot encoding
technique).

c) Aggregate data and group the data-based
protocol name and total bytes.

d) Apply unsupervised algorithm like Dbscan on testing dataset

P.S : prototype can be tested on vs studio code.
